# Prerequisities

1. Have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.
1. Some way to work with git repositories. Either the [`git` CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) or a desktop app such as [Git Fork](https://git-fork.com/).
1. A text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/) on your computer.
1. A [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com) account.
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Then login with your Dockerhub account. Warning: sometimes Docker uses processing power and battery even when it doesn't look that it's doing anything. You should disable *Start Docker Desktop when you log in* in Docker's preferences. Also, shut down Docker after you're down using it.
