# Go

## Hello World

*This example is from [go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started).*

Paste the following into a new file `hello.go`. It's a simple program that prints a greeting:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

In the terminal, execute the program by running:

```sh
$ go run hello.go
````

For example:

```sh
$ go run hello.go
Hello, World!
```

Delete `hello.go` before moving to the next section.

## Simple Server

*This example is from [gowebexamples.com](https://gowebexamples.com/hello-world/).*

Initialize the project using `go mod init`. This will create a `go.mod` file that is important for tracking your dependencies.

```sh
$ go mod init github.com/manifaust/learning-project
```

Replace `manifaust/learning-project` with your username and project name.

Paste the following into a new file `server.go`. It's a simple web server that prints out which path on the server you're requesting. It listens on port 80 which is a default HTTP port your browser will try to use:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, you've requested: %s\n", r.URL.Path)
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
}
```

When you run this program on the terminal, it won't stop, it'll just keep running until you hit Ctrl-C on the terminal.

```sh
$ go run server.go
```

MacOS will show a warning where you have to click Allow.

While the app is running, go to your browser and go to the website [`http://localhost`](http://localhost). You should see the message *Hello, you've requested: /*. Now if try to access [`http://localhost/hot-stuff`](http://localhost/hot-stuff) you'll see the message *Hello, you've requested: /hot-stuff*. When the server is handling your request, it figured out which path you wanted to see, and all it did is print out the name of the path.

Finish up by staging `go.mod` and `server.go`, then make a commit, and push the commit.
